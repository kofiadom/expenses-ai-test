The main issue is that it failed to apply the exception for travel receipts regarding supplier name, which is directly relevant to this case. Additionally, it missed validating receipt type requirements and didn't acknowledge the compliant elements (currency and amount). The AI correctly identified issues with missing supplier information, address, company registration, business trip reporting requirements, template usage, and personal information handling.",

The AI missed the exception for travel receipts allowing worker's name when employer name isn't possible, which makes the supplier name recommendation too strict. It also failed to include recommendations about receipt type requirements and currency exchange rate documentation. While most recommendations are valid, some could be more specific about how to achieve compliance rather than just stating what needs to be done. The existing recommendations do correctly address the need for proper reporting format, separate reports per trip, and personal information handling.",
