However, it made an unsupported assumption that this was an entertainment expense ('spese di rappresentanza') without evidence that the meal was offered to a client/supplier. The AI also failed to properly categorize the expense type before applying additional documentation requirements. Several validation checks were missing, including document quality assessment and determination if the expense was part of business travel. While core compliance issues were identified correctly, the AI made assumptions and omitted contextual considerations that affect the proper application of rules.",
