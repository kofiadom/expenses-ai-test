According to the source data, this is a restaurant receipt for meals, and the recommendations suggest 'addressing the issue with the supplier' which is inappropriate for a restaurant context. The compliance requirements indicate Global People's own company name/address/VAT must appear on invoices and receipts, but the AI doesn't clarify that this applies primarily to business expenses where the company is the direct purchaser, not to meal receipts from restaurants. The source data specifically indicates for 'Meals' under Global People that they are 'Not tax exempt' and only a receipt is needed with 'no additional information needed'. The recommendations should have addressed how to properly document a meal expense rather than suggesting changing restaurant receipts. More appropriate recommendations would include guidance on proper expense classification, noting the non-tax-exempt status, and explaining documentation requirements specific to meals.",
