The issues related to supplier name, supplier address, VAT number, payment method and tax code are all valid concerns based on the compliance database.

All extracted receipt data was accurately represented, and no hallucinated requirements were introduced.",

Four of the five issues have perfect knowledge base references. One reference (Tax Code) contains a minor formatting error, adding 'Tax Code:' prefix not present in the source. The AI may have missed validating receipt quality requirements which are mandatory per the source data. Overall, the validation is substantive and accurate, with only minor issues that don't significantly impact the reliability of the analysis.",
